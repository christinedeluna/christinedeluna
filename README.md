- 👋 Hi, I’m @christinedeluna
- 👀 I’m interested in all things AI 
- 🌱 I’m currently getting my masters in AI 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that help support the Ausitic community. 
- 📫 How to reach me: Christineabrego@yahoo.com or christineabrego@gmail.com -- gmail blocks a lot of emails so I have two addresses. 
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I created a side project to help bring together like minded ausistics. https://auventures.io/ More to come as I build out the page and build a product that helps support kids with austism
